    "This Python script is designed to generate responses to a few-shot prompt using several large language models (LLMs) via APIs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral. Here is a breakdown of its key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   - The `load_dotenv()` function loads API keys for the different LLM services from a `.env` file. This helps securely manage sensitive credentials like API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function: `openai_few_shot_prompt()`**:\n",
    "   - This function sends a few-shot learning prompt to the OpenAI API to generate a response from a model (e.g., `gpt-4`).\n",
    "   - It constructs the prompt by appending example prompts and responses to the user-provided input.\n",
    "   - API request parameters include model type, temperature, and token limits.\n",
    "   - If the API call is successful, it returns the model-generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function: `anthropic_few_shot_prompt()`**:\n",
    "   - Similar to the OpenAI function, this one constructs a few-shot prompt and makes a request to Anthropic's API (e.g., using models like `claude-3-5-sonnet`).\n",
    "   - The response is returned after being processed from the JSON data received from the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function: `run_mistral()`**:\n",
    "   - This function makes a request to the Mistral API with the user’s message, model, and configuration settings (e.g., temperature, token limits).\n",
    "   - It returns the Mistral model’s generated content or an error if the API call fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Function: `mistral_few_shot_prompt()`**:\n",
    "   - This function builds a few-shot prompt and calls `run_mistral()` to generate a response using the Mistral API.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Function: `generate_few_shot_prompts_with_all_models()`**:\n",
    "   - This function loops through several OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral models to generate responses to the same prompt using different models.\n",
    "   - It stores the responses in a dictionary where the keys are the model names and the values are the generated outputs.\n",
    "   - The function supports multiple models for each service, such as `gpt-4`, `claude-3-opus`, and `mistral-medium-latest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Main Program Execution**:\n",
    "   - API keys are fetched from environment variables.\n",
    "   - A user prompt is provided (e.g., \"Describe the impact of climate change on polar bears\"), along with examples.\n",
    "   - Lists of model names for each service are specified.\n",
    "   - The `generate_few_shot_prompts_with_all_models()` function is called to generate responses for the prompt from all the models.\n",
    "   - The results are printed, showing the response and word count for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script allows users to experiment with different LLMs and compare their responses to a given prompt, facilitating evaluation across various models from different providers."

This can result in nutritional stress, reduced survival rates, and lower reproductive rates for polar bears. Additionally, the warming Arctic may lead to increased human-bear interactions as bears spend more time on land, potentially resulting in conflicts with people.\n",

      "Climate change is causing the Arctic sea ice to melt earlier in the spring and form later in the fall, reducing the amount of time that polar bears have to hunt for seals, their primary food source. This makes it more difficult for polar bears to maintain their energy reserves and can lead to starvation and declines in population numbers. In addition, the loss of sea ice makes it more challenging for polar bears to travel long distances and find mates, further impacting their ability to reproduce and sustain their populations. Climate change also poses risks to the denning sites that pregnant polar bears rely on for giving birth and raising their cubs.\n",

      "Climate change is having a significant impact on polar bears and their habitats. Rising temperatures are causing sea ice to melt earlier in the spring and form later in the fall, reducing the amount of time polar bears have to hunt and feed. This can lead to decreased body condition and lower reproductive success. Additionally, as sea ice continues to decline, polar bears are being forced to spend more time on land, where food sources are limited and they may come into conflict with humans. These impacts are expected to continue and potentially worsen as climate change progresses.\n",

      "Climate change is significantly impacting polar bears, primarily through the loss of their sea ice habitat. As global temperatures rise, Arctic sea ice is melting earlier and forming later each year, reducing the time polar bears have to hunt seals, their primary prey. This decreased hunting opportunity leads to malnutrition, lower body weights, and reduced survival rates, particularly for cubs. Additionally, the melting sea ice forces polar bears to spend more time on land, leading to increased human-bear conflicts and potential habitat competition with other species like grizzly bears. The loss of sea ice also threatens the denning sites that pregnant polar bears need to give birth and nurse their cubs. Overall, climate change is a major threat to polar bear populations, with some studies predicting significant declines in their numbers if current warming trends continue.\n",
