    "This Python script generates text using multiple language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral. Here's a breakdown of its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Environment Setup**:\n",
    "   - **`load_dotenv()`**: This loads environment variables (API keys) from a `.env` file, which securely stores sensitive data like API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Text Generation Functions**:\n",
    "   - **`openai_generate_text()`**:\n",
    "     - This function sends a prompt to OpenAI's models (e.g., `gpt-4`).\n",
    "     - The function uses HTTP POST to communicate with OpenAI’s API, passing the prompt and other parameters like temperature, max tokens, and stop sequences.\n",
    "     - It returns the generated response or an error message if the request fails.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`anthropic_generate_text()`**:\n",
    "     - Similar to OpenAI, this function sends a prompt to Anthropic's models (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet`).\n",
    "     - It also handles HTTP POST requests and returns the generated text from the Anthropic API or an error message if it fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`run_mistral()`**:\n",
    "     - This function sends a prompt to Mistral’s API (e.g., `mistral-medium-latest`) and retrieves the generated response.\n",
    "     - It includes configurable parameters like temperature, max tokens, and others, and processes the response returned from the Mistral API.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`mistral_generate_text()`**:\n",
    "     - This function builds the prompt specifically for Mistral and calls `run_mistral()` to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Aggregated Text Generation**:\n",
    "   - **`generate_text_with_all_models()`**:\n",
    "     - This function takes a prompt and loops through a list of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral models to generate responses from each one.\n",
    "     - It stores the generated results from each model in a dictionary, keyed by the model name.\n",
    "     - The responses are generated using the three different APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral) by calling the respective functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Main Program**:\n",
    "   - **API Keys and Prompt Setup**:\n",
    "     - API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral are loaded from environment variables.\n",
    "     - The user prompt in this case is to \"Create a simple, healthy recipe using chicken breast, spinach, and quinoa.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Model Lists**:\n",
    "     - Lists of models for OpenAI (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`), Anthropic (`claude-3-5-sonnet`), and Mistral (`open-mistral-7b`, `mistral-medium-latest`) are defined.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Generating Text**:\n",
    "     - The function `generate_text_with_all_models()` is called to generate responses from all models for the given prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Results Output**:\n",
    "     - The results are printed for each model, showing the model name, word count, and the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This script is used to compare outputs from different AI models for a single prompt, allowing the user to evaluate how different models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral respond to the same input. It helps in cross-model evaluation and benchmarking."
