    "This Python script is designed to summarize a given text using multiple language models provided by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral APIs. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Environment Setup**:\n",
    "   - **`load_dotenv()`**: Loads environment variables, including the API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral. This allows secure storage of sensitive information like API keys, which are required to access these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Text Summarization Functions**:\n",
    "   - **`openai_summarize_text()`**:\n",
    "     - Sends the input text to OpenAI's models (e.g., `gpt-4`) for summarization.\n",
    "     - The function constructs a prompt that includes the task description (\"Summarize the following text\") and the actual input text.\n",
    "     - It makes an API request to OpenAI and retrieves the summarized text.\n",
    "     - Configurable parameters like temperature, max tokens, and stop sequences can be adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`anthropic_summarize_text()`**:\n",
    "     - Similar to the OpenAI function, it sends a request to the Anthropic API (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet`), asking for a summary of the provided text.\n",
    "     - The function handles the API request and returns the generated summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`run_mistral()`**:\n",
    "     - This is a helper function that sends a request to the Mistral API to generate a summary.\n",
    "     - It accepts parameters such as the input text (wrapped in a summarization task), temperature, and max tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`mistral_summarize_text()`**:\n",
    "     - This function formats the input text as a summarization task for Mistral and calls `run_mistral()` to generate the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Aggregated Summarization**:\n",
    "   - **`summarize_text_with_all_models()`**:\n",
    "     - This function iterates over the models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral to generate a summary for the same input text.\n",
    "     - It stores the generated summaries from each model in a dictionary, with the keys being the model names and the values being the summaries.\n",
    "     - The function processes multiple models from each API provider and gathers their outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Main Program Execution**:\n",
    "   - **API Keys and Input Text**:\n",
    "     - The API keys are retrieved from the environment variables, and the text to be summarized is defined (in this case, about the impact of climate change on polar bears).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Model Lists**:\n",
    "     - Lists of models for OpenAI (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`), Anthropic (`claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-3-opus`), and Mistral (`open-mistral-7b`, `mistral-medium-latest`) are specified for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Generating Summaries**:\n",
    "     - The function `summarize_text_with_all_models()` is called to generate summaries from each model for the given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Results Output**:\n",
    "     - The script prints the results, including the model name, word count of the summary, and the summarized text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This script allows users to compare the output of various models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral when tasked with summarizing the same piece of text. It's helpful for benchmarking and evaluating different models' performance in summarization tasks."
