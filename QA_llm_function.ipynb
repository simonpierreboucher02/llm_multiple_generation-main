    "This Python script generates answers to a question using multiple models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral APIs. Here is a summary of its main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Environment Setup**:\n",
    "   - **`load_dotenv()`**: This function loads environment variables (API keys) from a `.env` file, allowing secure access to the APIs for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Question Answering Functions**:\n",
    "   - **`openai_question_answer()`**:\n",
    "     - This function sends a user question (and optional context) to OpenAI's models (e.g., `gpt-4`) via an API request.\n",
    "     - The function formats the input as a user message, sends it to OpenAI’s API, and retrieves the generated answer.\n",
    "     - It supports configurable parameters like temperature, max tokens, and stop sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`anthropic_question_answer()`**:\n",
    "     - Similar to the OpenAI function, this sends a question (and context) to Anthropic’s models (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet`) using an API request.\n",
    "     - The function constructs the request and retrieves the generated response from the Anthropic API.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`run_mistral()`**:\n",
    "     - This is a helper function that sends user input to Mistral’s API to retrieve a response.\n",
    "     - It handles the API request and returns the response generated by the model (e.g., `mistral-medium-latest`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`mistral_question_answer()`**:\n",
    "     - This function formats the question (and optional context) for Mistral and uses the `run_mistral()` function to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Aggregated Question Answering**:\n",
    "   - **`answer_question_with_all_models()`**:\n",
    "     - This function iterates through lists of models for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral, generating answers for a given question and context.\n",
    "     - The function stores the responses in a dictionary, with the keys being the model names and the values being the generated answers.\n",
    "     - It loops through multiple models for each API and calls the respective functions to fetch answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Main Program**:\n",
    "   - **API Keys and Question Setup**:\n",
    "     - The API keys are fetched from environment variables.\n",
    "     - The question posed in this example is: \"What are the effects of climate change on polar bears?\"\n",
    "     - A detailed context is provided, explaining how climate change affects polar bears, such as habitat loss and malnutrition due to shrinking ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Model Lists**:\n",
    "     - Lists of models for OpenAI (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`), Anthropic (`claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-3-opus`), and Mistral (`open-mistral-7b`, `mistral-medium-latest`) are specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Generating Answers**:\n",
    "     - The function `answer_question_with_all_models()` is called to generate answers from all models for the given question and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Results Output**:\n",
    "     - The script prints the results for each model, displaying the model name, word count, and the generated answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This script is useful for comparing how different AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral respond to the same question and context. It enables cross-model evaluation, providing a comprehensive way to benchmark different large language models for question-answering tasks."

      "Climate change has several significant effects on polar bears, primarily through the melting of Arctic ice. Some of these effects include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Habitat loss: As Arctic ice melts due to rising temperatures, the polar bears' habitat shrinks. This makes it harder for them to hunt seals, as they rely on sea ice as a platform to catch their prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Reduced access to food: With less sea ice available, polar bears have a more challenging time finding and capturing seals, which are their primary source of food. This can lead to malnutrition and decreased body conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Decreased reproduction rates: Malnutrition caused by reduced access to food can negatively impact polar bears' reproductive success. Females in poor body condition may not be able to sustain pregnancy or produce healthy offspring.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Increased cub mortality: In times of food scarcity, cubs are more vulnerable and have higher mortality rates. Mothers may abandon cubs or fail to provide adequate nutrition, leading to decreased survival rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Greater energy expenditure: Polar bears may need to travel longer distances to find food or suitable sea ice, increasing their energy expenditure. This further contributes to malnutrition and decreased body conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Changes in distribution and abundance: As the Arctic warms, polar bears may shift their distribution towards areas with more stable sea ice. However, this could result in increased competition for resources among polar bear populations and potential conflicts with human settlements.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Threats from other species: As the Arctic ice melts, it is possible that other species, such as grizzly bears, could move into polar bear territories, leading to potential competition and conflicts.\n",

      "Climate change has several adverse effects on polar bears:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Habitat loss: As Arctic ice melts due to rising temperatures, polar bears lose their natural habitat. Polar bears rely on sea ice for hunting, resting, and breeding. With the reduction in sea ice, their habitat shrinks, forcing them into smaller, fragmented areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Decreased access to food: Polar bears primarily hunt seals on sea ice. As the ice melts, they have less access to this food source, which leads to malnutrition and starvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reduced reproduction rates: Malnutrition and starvation can negatively impact the reproductive health of polar bears. This can lead to lower birth rates, further threatening the survival of their species.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Increased competition and conflict: As their habitat shrinks, polar bears may be forced into closer proximity with each other, leading to increased competition for resources and potential conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Longer periods of food scarcity: With climate change, sea ice melts earlier in the year and freezes later, extending the period when polar bears may not have access to their primary food source. This can lead to prolonged fasting and increased stress on their bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Risk of drowning: Polar bears are strong swimmers but require sea ice as resting platforms between swims. As the distance between ice floes increases, polar bears may become exhausted and drown during long swims.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Exposure to diseases and parasites: With climate change, new diseases and parasites may emerge in the Arctic, posing additional threats to polar bear populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Human-polar bear conflicts: As polar bears are forced into closer contact with human settlements, the risk of conflicts increases, potentially leading to the death or relocation of polar bears.\n",

      "Climate change has several adverse effects on polar bears. Primarily, the melting of Arctic ice reduces their habitat, making it harder for them to hunt seals, which are their main food source. This forces them to swim longer distances in search of food, leading to exhaustion and malnutrition. Additionally, decreased access to seals negatively impacts their reproduction rates, as pregnant females require a high-fat diet to sustain their pregnancy and nourish their cubs. Furthermore, the warming of Arctic temperatures can also affect denning sites, potentially leading to the death of cubs. Overall, climate change poses a significant threat to polar bear populations.\n",

      "The effects of climate change on polar bears are severe and can be observed in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Habitat loss: The primary effect of climate change on polar bears is the melting of Arctic sea ice, which constitutes their primary habitat. Polar bears use sea ice as a platform to hunt seals, rest, and travel. As the ice melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the fall, the bears have less time to hunt and build up their fat reserves, causing them to spend more time on land where food sources are scarce.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Reduced food availability: With the loss of sea ice, polar bears have reduced access to their primary food source, seals. This leads to malnutrition and starvation, particularly among cubs and pregnant females who require more energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Decreased reproduction rates: Malnutrition resulting from reduced food availability can lead to lower reproductive success. Female polar bears need to reach a certain weight to ovulate and sustain pregnancy. Insufficient food can cause delays in reproduction or even complete reproductive failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Increased mortality: Climate change-related factors such as habitat loss, reduced food availability, and decreased reproduction contribute to increased mortality among polar bears. Starvation, drowning due to longer swims between ice floes, and conflicts with humans are all potential causes of death linked to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Changes in distribution and behavior: As sea ice disappears, polar bears may be forced to move to new areas in search of food and suitable habitat. This can result in increased human-polar bear interactions, potentially leading to conflicts and negative outcomes for both bears and people. Additionally, changes in behavior, such as feeding on alternative food sources like bird eggs or garbage, can put polar bears at risk and negatively impact their health.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Potential for disease and parasites: Changes in habitat and food sources can increase the risk of disease and parasite transmission among polar bears. Warmer temperatures may also facilitate the spread of pathogens and parasites, further threatening polar bear populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, climate change poses significant threats to polar bears through habitat loss, reduced food availability, decreased reproduction rates, increased mortality, changes in distribution and behavior, and potential for disease and parasites. Conservation efforts are crucial to mitigate these effects and protect polar bear populations.\n",

      "Climate change has several significant effects on polar bears, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Habitat Loss**: Polar bears rely on sea ice for hunting, resting, and breeding. As global temperatures rise due to climate change, the Arctic sea ice is melting earlier in the spring and forming later in the fall, reducing the time polar bears have to hunt and build up their fat reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reduced Access to Prey**: Polar bears primarily feed on seals, which they hunt from the surface of the sea ice. The loss of sea ice makes it more challenging for polar bears to catch their prey, leading to reduced food intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Malnutrition and Starvation**: With less time to hunt and reduced access to prey, polar bears are experiencing malnutrition. This can lead to starvation, particularly for younger bears and mothers with cubs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Decreased Reproduction Rates**: The physical condition of female polar bears greatly influences their reproduction rates. With less food, females are less likely to give birth to healthy cubs, and those that are born may have lower survival rates due to the mother's poor condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Increased Swimming Distances**: As sea ice melts and breaks apart, polar bears are forced to swim longer distances, which can be particularly challenging for young bears and can lead to drowning.\n",

      "7. **Disease and Parasites**: As temperatures rise, new diseases and parasites may become more prevalent in the Arctic, posing additional threats to polar bears' health.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Potential Hybridization**: In some areas, grizzly bears are moving north as the climate warms, leading to interbreeding with polar bears. While this is a natural process, it could potentially dilute the genetic uniqueness of polar bears over time.\n",
